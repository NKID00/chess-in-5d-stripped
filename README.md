## FAQ

### Isn't the game copyrighted?

Yes, the game '5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel' is under copyright by Thunkspace, LLC and any source code, written works, and other copyrightable materials are the property of Thunkspace, LLC. However, copyright does not extend to an idea, which include game rules. So as long as the new work does not contain a direct copy of the rules or other material within the original game. Well known precedent for this is Hasbro's lawsuit against Scrabulous in which they dropped it after Scrabulous removed material that could possible be considered violating copyright (https://www.cnet.com/news/hasbro-drops-scrabulous-lawsuit/).

Also of note is this article from the American Bar Association (https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2014-15/march-april/its_how_you_play_game_why_videogame_rules_are_not_expression_protected_copyright_law/).

Chess in 5D in no way aims to violate any copyright laws, but instead aims to be an open source implementation of the original ideas as presented by '5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel'.
