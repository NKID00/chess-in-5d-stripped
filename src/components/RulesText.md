# Chess in 5D Rules

## Work In Progress

These rules are still a work in progress.

## Introduction

When looking at the name Chess in 5D, it sounds just like any other multidimensional chess variant using an increasing amount of spatial dimensions.
However, in this variant, there are three spatial dimensions and two temporal dimensions instead.

Here are the dimensions listed:
 - Rank - The vertical axis same as regular chess
 - File - The horizontal axis same as regular chess
 - Height - Third spatial dimension that is unused within the game
 - Turn - The first temporal (time-based) dimension, in which pieces travel back in time
 - Timeline - The second temporal dimension in which pieces travel across separate timelines

This may look confusing at first, so an example game may help explain.

# Example Game / How To Play

Open another tab to follow along [https://chessin5d.net/#/local/game/human](https://chessin5d.net/#/local/game/human). Uncheck the 'Timed Game' checkbox and click on the 'Start' button.

Here is the starting board of Chess in 5D. This is the exact same starting board as regular chess. In fact, when not utilizing the temporal dimensions, Chess in 5D pieces move along the Rank / File dimension in the same way as regular chess.

Let's make the first move: `1w. 1:e2:e3` (regular chess equivalent is `e3`). To do this, select the `e2` pawn and then select the `e3` square. Do not press the 'Submit' button first.

*We'll go over the notation later*

Here, notice two boards have been created. The first original board is unchanged and the new board has the pawn moved. This represents a timeline, with boards on the left representing the past.

Also, notice that the two boards have two different outlines, one white and one black. The board on the left has the white outline and the board on the right has the black outline. These represent the player's turn when that board was in play.

In order to finish white's turn, click on the 'Submit' button.

Doing the similar process above, let's play the move: `1b. 1:e7:e6` (regular chess equivalent is `e6`).

After moving the pawn, press the submit button.

By now, you can see more and more boards get created every move that gets played.

Let's make our first move using time travel.

We are going to play this move: `2w. 2:Nb1<+1>1:b3` (no regular chess equivalent)

To play this move, select the knight on `b1` on the right most board. Then select the `b3` square on the left most board. Submit when done.

What is happening here?!?

If you think about how time travel works in fiction, one of the common problems with time travel is the 'Grandfather Paradox'. This is the idea that if you can travel back in time and you kill your grandfather, how can you be born to travel back in time? In order to avoid this paradox, the game of Chess in 5D creates a new timeline whenever a move would change the past of a timeline.

This new timeline is the board below the four other boards.

Here in this move, the knight moved two turns into the past. Because you cannot have a paradox, a new timeline is spawned. This timeline now has the new knight, where as the original timeline has the knight missing.

We'll go over how the pieces can move along the Turn / Timeline dimension later, for now assume this is a legal move.
