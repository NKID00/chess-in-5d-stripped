# Chess in 5D Rules

## Introduction

When looking at the name Chess in 5D, it sounds just like any other multidimensional chess variant using an increasing amount of spatial dimensions.
However, in this variant, there are three spatial dimensions and two temporal dimensions instead.

Here are the dimensions listed:
 - Rank - The vertical axis same as regular chess
 - File - The horizontal axis same as regular chess
 - Height - Third spatial dimension that is unused within the game
 - Turn - The first temporal (time-based) dimension, in which pieces travel back in time
 - Timeline - The second temporal dimension in which pieces travel across separate timelines

 This may look confusing at first, so a quick example may help explain.
